    "- Angrist, Battistin, and Vuri (2017) add to the literature by investigating the implications of test score manipulation for the CSR research using data on INVALSI tests, yearly standardized tests covering mathematics and Italian language skills and administered to certain grades of all Italian schools.\n",
    "    - Based on Angrist and Lavy (1999), the authors first employ a **parametric fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) design** that exploits mandatory class-size caps to estimate the effect of smaller classes on student achievement for second and fifth-graders, then examine the role of score manipulation in explaining the substantial gap in estimates of class-size effects between Southern Italy and the rest of the country. In fact, it appears that teachers in the South have engaged to a greater extent in shirking when correcting and transcribing the results of the paper-based tests. The final model, which is augmented with an **instrumental variable** for score manipulation, finds that class-size effects vanish. The main contribution of this paper lies in illustrating how in certain test settings smaller classes can incentivize test score manipulation and thereby drive estimates of class-size effects."

    "    - As shown in Figure2 and 3, $D_1$ can be instrumented by the class size predicted by Maimonides' Rule $Z_1$, which in turn is a function of grade enrollment (the running variable $X$).

Because it cannot be assumed that $Y$ and $D_2$ are not driven by common unobservables, as suggested by the fact that the varying nature of manipulation patterns across regions cannot be accounted for, the back-door path ($D_1 \\rightarrow D_2 \\rightarrow Y$) cannot be closed by conditioning on score manipulation $D_2$.\n",
    "    - Therefore, **another source of exogenous variation is needed to identify the effect of $D_2$ on $Y$.**\n",

It should be noted that the data related to the demographic and socioeconomic background of pupils are reported by the school staff, while the other controls are administrative in nature or collected by the INVALSI institute. This distinction will be relevant when discussing misreporting. As the relationship of grade enrollment with the endogenous and the outcome variables is influenced by geographical factors (see Figures 4 to 6), equation $(2)$ is then augmented by adding the polynomial interaction between the running variable and the region dummy and other terms that allow the quadratic function to change over enrollment-windows (the \"interacted model\").
